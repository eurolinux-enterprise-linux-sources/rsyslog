-Also, in v3 a full restart will be done in order to read changed configuration files.
-Note that this means a full rsyslogd restart is done. This has, among others,
-the consequence that TCP and other connections are torn down. Also, if any
-queues are not running in disk assisted mode or are not set to persist data

-this restart functionality of HUP (it will go away in v5). So it is advised to use
-HUP only for closing files, and a "real restart" (e.g. /etc/rc.d/rsyslogd restart)
-to activate configuration changes.
